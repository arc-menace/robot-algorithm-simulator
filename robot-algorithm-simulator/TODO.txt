What I know I need to do but don't want to do right now:
robot.h:

block.h:
 - Add logging Functions
 - Change random number generating function to return decimal numbers;

obstacle.h:
 - Add logging functions
 
map.h - Can wait until robot, blocks and obstacles are done:
 - create file
 - create class
 - Add logging functions
 - Check to make sure that default values are assigned upon object creation
 
mothership.h - Can wait until robot, blocks and obstacles are done:
 - create file
 - create class 
 - define logic for position based upon dimensions in rules
 - add logging functions
 - add vector to hold blocks

 environment.h:
 - obstacle move functions
 - random obstacle generation function
 - block move functions
 - random block generation function
 - robot pick up block function
 - robot end signal/end simulation function
 - map generation function
 - mothership generation function
 - collision detection to run during movement functions
 - Fall Detection
 - Diagonal movement functions should use sin and cos on x and y
 - Add support for compound shapes in intersect function
 - Fix class hierarchy for object interaction detection
 - Look into a way to combine the intersect and encapsulate functions
 - Intersection function does not work

 event.h:
 - add collision event class
 - add block pick up event class
 - add block place class
 - add end of sim class
 - add point scored change (+ or -)
 - Finish write event functions for Block Picked up and BLock created

 log.h:
 - Fix write_log function to work better with the print_event() function

 object.h:
 - Change default contructor in class hierarchy

 main.cpp:
 - adjust problem with map orientation from viewers perspective (everything is backward)
 - set up algorithm file

Menu:
 - Redo all the definition funtions for changing settings
 - Allow for custom settings to be saved or loaded
 - Allow to leave as default and skip a particular setting when setting custom settings
