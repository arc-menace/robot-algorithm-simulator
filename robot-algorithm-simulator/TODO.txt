What I know I need to do but don't want to do right now:
robot.h:
 - Add logging functions

block.h:
 - Add logging Functions

obstacle.h:
 - Function to set random position
 - Add logging functions
 
map.h:
 - Add logging functions
 - Check to make sure that default values are assigned upon object creation
 
mothership.h
 - create file
 - create class 
 - define logic for position based upon dimensions in rules
 - add logging functions
 - add vector to hold blocks

 Redo all the definition funtions for changing settings
 Allow for custom settings to be saved or loaded
 Allow to leave as default and skip a particular setting

 The big stuff to do:
 Create Environment in main to hold all objects and track stuff

 Logging Class

 Cinder stuff
